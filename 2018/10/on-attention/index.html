		</h2>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<p>In recent years, I have struggled with my attention. I have struggled to focus
on much of anything in my life. I haven't been able to read books quickly or
effectively; I have struggled to get into that superfocused programming state
at work.</p>
<p>I assumed that perhaps I had undiagnosed ADHD. Who knows, that may even be
true. But increasingly I think it's more likely that I've done this to myself.</p>
<p>Since I got my first smartphone in 2009, I have been in a constant mode of
stimulation. Around that same time I discovered podcasts and audiobooks. These
were a boon to me, especially on commutes. Suddenly I felt like that time was
no longer wasted.</p>
<p>Social media became ubiquitous. Reddit had a constant stream of fascinating or
interesting content. Twitter vied for my attention. Algorithms worked to keep
me engaged all of the time.</p>
<p>It's not an interesting story, nor an original one. Our reading lists are full
of books about <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Break-Up-Your-Phone/dp/039958112X">breaking up with our phones</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arguments-Deleting-Social-Media-Accounts/dp/125019668X">deleting social media</a>,
and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hyperfocus-More-Productive-World-Distraction-ebook/dp/B077LWZC6Q">reclaiming our focus</a>. But the one who finally made me see the problems
in my own life was <a href="http://www.cgpgrey.com/">CGP Grey</a>. On the (amazing) podcast <a href="http://www.hellointernet.fm/">Hello Internet</a>,
he <a href="https://overcast.fm/+B1qzR7TJI">explored this problem in his own life</a>. His story was remarkably similar
to mine. I especially empathized with his problems with podcasts. Don't get me
wrong -- podcasts are incredible. The world of podcasts has never been better,
and podcasts are one of only a few things that haven't been consumed by
algorithms (yet). They are a net positive in the world. But my problems with
podcasts are a symptom of something larger (in myself).</p>
<p>I found myself rarely without headphones in my ears. The breaking point was
when I found myself putting my Airpods in for the <em>30 seconds</em> that it took me
to go to the bathroom. Silence made me physically uncomfortable. I used
headphones as an excuse to avoid interacting with people. It was a real
problem.</p>
<p>Another problem area I identified was slack (and to a lesser extent, email).
Having these amazing tools available all the time on my phone (and open all day
on my computer), I found myself self-interrupting constantly throughout the day
to see if there was something new in the #videogames channel, the #photography
channel, or in our team or service channels. Even when there were no
notifications, I would interrupt and check my slack or email. A combination of
my proclivity to procrastinate and my brains addiction to these inputs was
letting me get nothing done.</p>
<p>It was also encroaching on my family life. I would open slack when I first woke
up in the morning and find a notification from someone in India. Rather than
waiting until my workday started, I would reply and end up working for an
hour. The same thing would happen on weekends or in the evenings.</p>
<h2>My solution</h2>
<p>I cut out all podcasts and audiobooks for almost a month. This was just a reset
-- there was never any chance I would stay away from podcasts. But I needed
some time, and needed some silence.</p>
<p>I've since resumed podcasts, but don't listen to them first thing in the
morning, or before bed. I try to limit them to commutes and chores, or times
when I consciously decide to listen (and decide it won't interrupt my
interactions with my family).</p>
<p>With permission from my manager, I instituted (and communicated) a new policy
for email and slack. I would only check them at the beginning and end of the
workday, and never outside of work hours or on the weekends. I gave out my cell
number and told people to call me instead.</p>
<p>I disabled most notifications on my phone, including all email notifications.
(My personal email is never urgent, either). I completely signed out of my work
slack.</p>
<p>I also set a goal to read for an average of an hour a day.</p>
<p>Note that I wasn't trying to reduce screen time. I love video games and have no
desire to stop playing them. But I wanted my time to be used with
intentionality -- to never feel like I've been wasting time on useless phone
games and pointless reddit threads.</p>
<h2>Did it work?</h2>
<p>I think so! I'm still in the middle of it, but I'm getting more done at work
than I have in months. I'm reading more than I have in years. And my phone
pickups have fallen by more than half. I interact more with my family, and am
becoming OK with silence.</p>
<h2>So?</h2>
<p>I know, this is long and rambling. And perhaps you don't have any of the same
problems that I have and continue to fight.</p>
<p>But if any of this resonated with you, I encourage you to make a change. Your
solutions may not look like mine -- everyone has different goals and needs. But
we need to control our own lives.</p>
<p>Technology and the internet are amazing tools. Let's use them, rather than
letting them use us.</p>
